## React Map Array

To run this application, use Terminal to navigate into the project folder and run this script: ```npm start```. This application demonstrates my ability to map through an array using React. The mentioned array is held in state within the App Component. The array is passed as a prop to the Child Component, which then maps it. The results are displayed in the browser.
